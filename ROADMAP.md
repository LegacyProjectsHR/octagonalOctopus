# RoadMap Document for Definitely Not Avalon

  This document encoded high level planning. It is not intended to be as
  granular as the project [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/noqaSD47/greenfield-app), nor is it
  guaranteed to be up to date. 

## Features and Tech Debt (Rough priority Order)

1. Finish DB Schema design
2. Complete investigation of web sockets as client/server communication
   pipeline
3. Decide on architecture of the server/client rendering path choice
4. Write server side game logic
5. Flesh out client rendering stubs
6. Flesh out server side websocket/ request handling functions
7. Investigate extent of history reporting
8. Consider login and what level of authentication is needed
